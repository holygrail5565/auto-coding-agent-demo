## 📖 What is auto-coding-agent-demo?

auto-coding-agent-demo is a software project created to run a full 10-hour AI programming experiment automatically. It uses artificial intelligence to write code without needing any user input during the process. This demo shows how an AI can take on programming tasks and complete them on its own over an extended period.

You don't need any programming skills to try it. The software handles everything for you once you start it. This makes it useful for anyone curious about AI in programming or looking to see automated coding in action.
